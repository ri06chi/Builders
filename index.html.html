		 both a noun and a verb: the structure itself 
		 and the act of making it. As a noun, a building
		 is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and
		 stands more or less permanently in one place'
		 ;[1] "there was a three-storey building on the
		 corner"; "it was an imposing edifice". In the
		 broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a 
		 building.[2] However, the word structure is
		 used more broadly than building including
		 natural and man-made formations[3] and does not
		 necessarily have walls.
